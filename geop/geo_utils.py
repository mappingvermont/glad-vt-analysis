    """"
    For a given polygon, returns a numpy masked array with the intersecting
    values of the raster at `raster_path` unmasked, all non-intersecting
    cells are masked.  This assumes that the input geometry is in the same
    SRS as the raster.  Currently only reads from a single band.

    Args:
        geom (Shapley Geometry): A polygon in the same SRS as `raster_path`
            which will define the area of the raster to mask.

        raster_path (string): A local file path to a geographic raster
            containing values to extract.

        mods (optional list): A list of modifications to make to the source
            raster, provided as json objects containing the following keys:

            geom (geojson): polygon of area where modification should be
                applied.
            newValue (int|float): value to be written over the source raster
                in areas where it intersects geom.  Modifications are applied
                in order, meaning subsequent items can overwrite earlier ones.

        all_touched (optional bool|default: True): If True, the cells value
            will be unmasked if geom interstects with it.  If False, the
            intersection must capture the centroid of the cell in order to be
            unmasked.

    Returns
       Numpy masked array of source raster, cropped to the extent of the
       input geometry, with any modifications applied. Areas where the
       supplied geometry does not intersect are masked.
